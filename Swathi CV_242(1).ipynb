    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My objective as a Geo-technical Earthquake Engineer is to conceptualize innovative solutions geared towards addressing risks involved in geo-engineering projects. My over five years experience as a geo-technical engineer in research has exposed me to different engineering techniques and processes in terms of planning and control methods. I have a concrete background in earthquake risk identification, quantification and mitigation and I am also very familiar with all design parameters of structural foundations and sub-surface structures. In addition, I am also very adept in using computer applications such as PLAXIS-2D,DEEP SOIL, LPILE, Q-GIS, PSHA and Surfer. With this said, I am truly confident that I can achieve this objective.</p><br>\n",
